Q3. Prog2 is the better design because it uses the getter and setter method which runs through and 
tells the user if it is equal to null or not and uses loose coupling betwen the classes which works
 with the program. The first program is not ideal because it does not use the setter and getter 
methods which also uses tight coupling.

Q4. The code is too bunched up into one class. There are unnessasary elements in the code 
that should be in another class instead. High cohesion is needed to improve the code.
